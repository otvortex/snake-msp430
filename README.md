# LED Snake Final Project for EC450

## What it intends to do

Our final project is intended to be a classic game of *Snake* displayed on an 8x8 array of LEDs, controlled by a directional pad made of 4 buttons.

## What it does do

We have successfully completed the project. If the snake eats the apple, the snake grows by one unit. If the snake runs into a wall or itself, the game is over and resets. The game can be run at different speeds, effectively acting as difficulty levels. The game can also be run where the user inches the snake forward manually.

## What you will see

We will demonstrate the snake game being run in manual mode, where we will control the forward movement with the direction pad. In the second stage of the demo we will flip on the game in automatic mode at **medium** difficulty.
